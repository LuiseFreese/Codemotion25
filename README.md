# Codemotion25
Repo that holds slides for my talk at Codemotion 25 about why your testing strategy is broken and how we can fix it!

I loved to be on stage and would also love to return next year - could you do me a favor and spend 20 seconds to open the codemotion app on your phone and rate my session? Grazie mille üôè

You can find all the slides as a PDF, if you have any question, you can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luisefreese).

Anyone interested in a workshop to get more hands-on?! LMK!
